Title:
    Lost Atoll - Part 3

Description:
    After scaling the grime-encrusted walls of a deep sewage
    pit and nimbly bounding back and forth across a waste-
    reclamation system, you wind up in a storage room.

    Though safe for the moment, the only exit appears to be
    locked. While assessing your options, you notice the
    floor is... vibrating? Almost like an otherwordly thrum
    is shaking the very structure of the immediate area.

Additional Credits:
    Phoenix, for helping me alpha test this thing before
    subjecting the rest of our group to it. The Gang: Toast,
    SiberX, Cent, Indiana, and Ace7 for playing practically
    the entire repository of escape maps available for TFC
    together as a group over several years: it helped push me
    to create my own map.

* Hints: check only if you're stuck so as to not spoil yourself! *

Experiment chamber:
    Use your teammate(s) to spot for you if you don't have a
    good vantage point. A light touch might help if precision
    is needed. You'll encounter resistance at the top: you'll
    need to be quick.

Reactor core:
    Some cooling rods are irradiated differently than others:
    find out what each colour does before attempting anything.
    Progress is made by standing on the shoulders of giants,
    though your teammates' shoulders should suffice here.

Bonus challenge:
    Access the bonus challenge by finding all six hidden buttons
    across all three maps, and remembering the six-digit code the
    buttons provide!
