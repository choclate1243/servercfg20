Title:
    Lost Atoll - Part 2

Description:
    After bypassing a deadly security system and draining a
    flooded cafeteria, you find yourselves in the sewage
    system of this sprawling underground complex.

    The stench is overwhelming, but remaining in the bowels
    of this place would only mean certain death. You must
    find a way to climb out of the cavernous pit before you
    if there is to be any hope of survival.

Additional Credits:
    Phoenix, for helping me alpha test this thing before
    subjecting the rest of our group to it. The Gang: Toast,
    SiberX, Cent, Indiana, and Ace7 for playing practically
    the entire repository of escape maps available for TFC
    together as a group over several years: it helped push me
    to create my own map.

* Hints: check only if you're stuck so as to not spoil yourself! *

Sewage pit:
    Despite the quality of the water, this is the perfect time
    for some surfing. That ventilation duct could help ease the
    pain of failure, but you'll have to be a fan of jumping.
    Or perhaps a jumping fan?

Waste processing:
    Not every roller needs to be used on the way to the key.
    Despite rotating, the rollers are surprisingly easy to stand
    on. Those fuseboxes look fragile: they keep a door closed,
    and you from falling. Jump as soon as you land on a roller
    when starting your way back up.

More in part 3!
