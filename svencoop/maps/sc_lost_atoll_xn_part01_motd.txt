Title:
    Lost Atoll

Description:
    During a boating trip, a storm capsizes the original
    vessel you were on, leaving you with a rickety lifeboat
    in the middle of a storm.

    After drifting all night at sea, you land on a deserted
    atoll just as your lifeboat gives up its seaworthiness.
    The island you find yourself on is small and without much
    in terms of resources.

    Chances of survival on this island look bleak, but
    something isn't quite right: there's an artificial feel
    to the sand and the flora. You don't recall seeing any
    islands on the map you had before capsizing. You also
    swear you can hear a faint hum coming from somewhere...

Additional Credits:
    Phoenix, for helping me alpha test this thing before
    subjecting the rest of our group to it. The Gang: Toast,
    SiberX, Cent, Indiana, and Ace7 for playing practically
    the entire repository of escape maps available for TFC
    together as a group over several years: it helped push me
    to create my own map.

* Hints: check only if you're stuck so as to not spoil yourself! *

Deserted island:
    The island is not as natural as it seems, check every
    corner and crevice.

Security checkpoint:
    The walls are free of obstruction, use them to your
    advantage. Carefully consider the outcome of damaging the
    computer in the control booth.

Cafeteria:
    Only the tables and chairs sink, everything else is solid.
    The bridge is over load capacity, but this could be used to
    your benefit. The red TV might not be worth watching, if
    you're clever.

More in part 2!
